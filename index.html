					<p>Typography is the base in which most web and print design are built upon. Before you start adding in photos, videos, or colors you should set your type—“if i can’t read your text, you’re wasting my time”.  Both Tahoma and Palatino are used to creature texture between headings and body copy, and  centered and justified alignments used to create symmetry. The base type size is set at 8px,  with six heading sizes ranging from in your face, to subtle.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Grids allow us to design with structure in mind. That being said, most grids that you see today are based on the 12 column grid. This 12 column grid allows the flexibility that designers look for, while keeping everything as simple and streamline as possible. If you’re are looking for something crazy or that has never been done before, than this probably isn’t for you, but as the famous saying goes “if it ain’t broke, why fix it”?</p>
