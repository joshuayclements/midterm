			<p class="credits">BY: JOSHUA Y. CLEMENTS</p>
			<p class="welcome">Welcome to "Frame Yo Work", a frame work that uses Sass to create compartmentalized css files that allows developers to work efficiently while staying organized.</p>

					<p>With an ever expanding list of typefaces that are available for web use, selecting the right typeface or type-pairing is one of the easiest ways to distinguish your webpage from the rest. Whether large or small, each webpage’s goal is to display it’s content in an organized and appealing manor—that's why choosing a typeface that reflects the mood of your content but also remains legible after being stylized is a crucial part of any design. So before you start adding in your amazing photos, videos, and color palettes, take a moment to find the right typeface, because “if I can’t read it, you’re wasting my time”.</p>
					</div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Frame Yo Work uses the typeface Work Sans, a free font designed by Wei Huang for google, which comes in 9 weights ranging from 100-900 and is implemented using a link tag that google provides. The base font size for the body of the html file is set at 16px, with a line height of 1.4 and a font weight of 300. The headings of this frame work use the font family’s heavier font weights (600, 700, 800, 900) in combination with a typographic scale of 1.6 in order to clearly define each section. Pairing these these heavy font weights with a thin weight helps to add texture to the web page and also creates a hierarchy system.</p>

					<p>Whether you build a website from scratch or use a frame work to expedite the process, nearly all websites these days use a grid system that allow s designers to have control of their webpages design and structure.  Some of the more popular grid systems today use 12 column system as it allows designers the most flexibility with their design. But as with most things in life not all webpages are created equal, so it is important to understand how your content interacts with your grid the how your layout responds to different media sizes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Frame Yo Work uses a 12 column grid with a total width of 100% within a  960px wide container. This allows the columns and their contents to be flexible when users resize their browser windows and also helps to ensure that elements stay within their respective areas depending on the size of the users device. Based on the size of the content any combination of columns can be set to display as inline-block as long as their total add up to 12.</p>

				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Every website you visit is trying to communicate something. So when you want to respond back you’re going to need a form. Here are some basic examples of forms that are commonly used on the web. But don’t let their blandness get you down, because just like every other element of web design, they're easily customizable.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>Grids allow us to design with structure in mind. That being said, most grids that you see today are based on the 12 column grid. This 12 column grid allows the flexibility that designers look for, while keeping everything as simple and streamline as possible. If you’re are looking for something crazy or that has never been done before, than this probably isn’t for you, but as the famous saying goes “if it ain’t broke, why fix it”?</p>

			<h2>Yo Buttons</h2>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-1"></div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>The purpose of a button is to guide a user through a website, therefore they should be easily distinguishable from other elements while not drawing to much attention to themselves. Just like an image or type, buttons can either help or hurt a website's overall design, so when in doubt just remember “less is more”.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-5">
					<p>For this frame work, two styles of buttons are used to show how both a plain and a stylized button can be implemented into any design while still respecting the over-all flow of the frame work. It is also handy to have two styles of buttons when designing a webpage in-case there are buttons that play a more important roles than others.</p>
